# 2020 United States Mental Health Analysis
## Lindsey Fisher â€“ February 2022
Using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey (BRFSS) published by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), this analysis attempts to identify critical drivers of poor mental health among American citizens. A Gradient Boosting Model was chosen as the best classification model with an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 83%. From this model, the 15 most important predictors were extracted and visualized. This project attempts to identify population segments that may benefit from additional mental health assistance with these visualizations. The recommendations are detailed below: 
1) Target mental health support for the following populations:
  - Under 40, especially the 18-24 segment of young adults. 1 in 5 persons in the 18-24 segment report 14+ days of poor mental health in the past 30 days.
  - States experiencing above-average proportion of residents experiencing poor mental health. Average = 12.2%
  - Persons who are unable to afford medical care or those who are uninsured
  - Persons who are unable to work or unemployed
  - Current smokers 
  - Persons reporting their race as Native American or Other
  - Females 
  - Separated, divorced, never-married, or long-term unmarried couples 
  - Persons engaging in high-risk behaviors related to HIV
  
 2) Further research factors that may be both symptoms and drivers of poor mental health 
  - difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
  - poor physical health  
  - average sleep time
  - difficulty doing errand/other tasks alone
